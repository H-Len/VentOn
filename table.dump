11	2022-02-16 05:46:32	2022.02.15 and Pfizer	Venting on, on this application as it's meant. I hurt, well, dull pain in my head. And tired: physically and emotionally. I received a booster for the covid-19 vaccine today. Tomorrow will be... will be. For now, I need to go to bed, but I don't want to. I don't want to go to the same bed as John. I don't want him there with me; I don't want to cuddle and I don't want him in the same bed. Or room. I don't want to be woken up by his sleep apnea. I don't want to wake up to him there. I don't want to wake up to negative emotions and inability to sleep and... and... and I should go to bed now.\r\nA new day tomorrow. A booster's side effect to get past.\r\n\r\nBut, damn it. I don't like John being patient and just listening to me vent and complain and to listen as though it's just a passing phase and nothing to be worried about. I'm tired but there IS a wolf. I'm not just saying it. If I had the energy I'd take you to see. \r\n\r\nBut would it be worth it? I'd get what I *want*, but probably at the expense of some things that I need. I don't want John. But how much of the not wanting him is because I need him. I don't want to need someone. I want to be independent. I want something that's mine. I don't want to be someone's someone.\r\nI've waited to long. I haven't spoken up when I needed to or done things or taken the action I needed. Now it's too late.\r\n\r\nNow I feel the pull of the end and it's time to let myself to be sucked into the vortex of fatigue and black hole of sleep.\r\nBlack hole until at least 7:00am, please. :}	0	0

It's not worth it. And, [grumble] I hate my roommate. He's great to see outside the apt. Nice to go on walks, sometimes, but inside? We are so different. \r\nbreathing now...	0	0
15	2022-02-19 01:36:28	phew, it works!	I wanted to write a short while ago, but it was telling me that I didn't have permission. \r\nAh, the constraints of virtual journals.\r\nWhatever, it's working now, and I'm writing now.\r\n\r\nThe day feels sooooooooooo long. I got up at around 6:30, naturally, and chose to stay up rather than go back to sleep for 25m after WC. And there was PT today. AND I walked with trekking poles down to *$s. and read there with a match gr tea. Then trek back up. Now just discouraged, still, but I didn't fall. So, that's good. I'll try to take it easy tomorrow. Oh! but tomorrow I pick up my scooter. I'll have it, but WHY?!?!!? It's not like I can go anywhere. ƒ¨ç˚ˆ˜© stupid covi-sars-2 and not wanting to get sick and following guidelines and ÏÂÒ. hmmm, the option-caps of FML is interesting. I'll stick to ÏÂÒ.\r\n\r\nNow, what to do next? I WANT _something_ to look forward to. Covid-19 is in the process of becoming endemic. Humans are killing themselves, or the planet, but the planet should be able to recover, after us. or something will happen. WHAT THE FUCK AM I GOING TO DO ?!??!?!?!? Go to school--for learning or leading toward a job--work on upwork, leave my husband, family, current home, safety, just fuck around, drink(sake o nomu?), try a completely new activity. Say whatever or goodbye to what I know and go towards the unknown. Breath?\r\npiano? no?\r\nSell the table on which I fractured my toe, or don't sell it? Fly away? Train? Go to NYC to visit someone I met online and meet their wife, or go to CA to meet someone else I just met?\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a meetup group, again? Keep coding? Watch TV? Try drawing with my diminishing manual ability? Sing? Gain wait from desserts??\r\nWrite a book? Learn Chinese and work with Sarah on it at Park Ave. Cafe?\r\nLearn German and speak to John in German, and read Mein Kompf in German. Study German and Germany?\r\nStudy and then move there?\r\n\r\nJoin a synagogue? continue with Duties of the Heart? \r\n\r\nGah! I'm sore. Oh well. Hopefully muscles will grow, and either way I'll recover.\r\n\r\nOff to coding now so that the postings will be listed, not just grouped one after another in a row.\r\nAnd, one day, the returns and spacing will be maintained in the display when the post is opened.	0	0
16	2022-02-19 04:33:07	Another major step for my coding!	I made many additions this evening for formatting.\r\n\r\nI think I can take a break for tonight and go to sleep...content.	0	0

29	2022-03-12 14:03:16.234675	Kindness as a norm	It was so nice today, what I witnessed.\r\nI was rolling past McMenamin's, past a table full of people. I noticed one man seemed to have a scar on his head. A waiter I knew was by them, too. After I past, I heard one say he was getting up to use the restroom. Next, I thought I saw a white stick (walking stick for blind). I thought I saw a snippet/flash of it multiple times.\r\nWhen I looked back the man with the scar had the stick and his hand was on the shoulder of the waiter.\r\nThey were walking smoothly, and quickly, to the entrance.\r\nIt was just so nice to see someone else with a challenge, and for whom it didn't look out of place. Just something you deal with and life continues, around you and for you. Nothing odd about it.\r\nIt was moving, for me. Warming and so nice to see.	0	0

95	2022-05-26 16:29:05.545223	>< always ALWAYS NEVER	I'm so mixed up right now. I move forward with a goal, a direction, a possibility to keep me going forward. But what do you do when you find there /are/ no possibilities? That there is no way out. What happens when what kept you going forward is gone?	2	3
18	2022-02-22 23:59:05	sufficient: now let's vent!	I'm stopping tickling CSS and just journaling now. I may have left a thing or two in the .css file that isn't needed or that is ineffective or .... could be deleted without effects.\r\n\r\nI want to vent now, though.\r\n\r\nI know that college years and 20s are past me, but I'm not past living. When I say college is past, I mean the opportunity for some experiences, or simply the novelty, are past. I am not old, but I have experience(s). Now I want to know what's next, rather then what I want to redo.\r\n\r\n{random note: my nails are really long. As in, too* long for typing...seamlessly.}\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, by the way: today is Twosday, 22,2,22\r\nI want something new, but not something new, of the same oldd thing, without a reason...(I.e. take a class just to take it...to have it as a new experience.\r\n\r\nSo, what next...?\r\nNo more accidents*, PLEASE. Moments of humility. I'm content with no more. I know others say moments of humiliation, but I'll stick to humility. Maybe because in some ways, humiliation is a negative emotion one has no control over. and it's static. Humility is a state to which you can decide on your response/ how you'll move forward. It's also more of a dynamic state in that one can learn and grow with it. (not just because of it.\r\n\r\nI want to have control over something. Ergo, I code. One day, maybe more, but for now I have this journal. Full stack. Woohoo!!!\r\n\r\nI hear someone speaking in Arabic behind me. Maybe I'll learn to speak in that language one day. Maybe John's right in that I find reasons NOT to do things. I'll try to just do things now. Find WHY NOT?!? I'll try to keep that attitude this year.\r\n\r\nYes I need to be mindful of what I engage in do to MS, though not many things I can't b/c of marriage...just MS things to keep in mind. I.E. Don't go on a 12 hour drive wihtout breaks.  Unless I have depends, perhaps. Don't go to a bar and get drunk. Maybe just don't get drunk. Well, It has been months...\r\n\r\nNow, about John. I yank him all around. I love you; I'm leaving you; I can't stand this relationship; I can't live without you...this...; wow, thank you.\r\nIn the end I think I'll stay. Maybe.\r\nIt's not *too late* to leave, but just like pregnancy, I can't do it in my 20s...or 30s... though I don't want pregnancy. The more time goes by the more foreign of an idea it seems.\r\n\r\nI like Friended. I like Rocco. I am going to try to trust.\r\n\r\nMore venting later.\r\n	0	0
19	2022-02-23 15:44:36	living by the stick	I have motivated myself in many situations with a stick. Think: carrot and the stick. I motivate myself with negative. Or often did in the past.\r\nNow, I'm debating what is a stick and what is a true negative to avoid.\r\nI am currently of the mind that if I don't do all that I can--all that's in my power/control--to moderate MS things, everything will get worse much more quickly and I'll deteriorate and the world will end and it will all have been in vein and it will all be my fault. Now that that simple idea is out there here are some of the evidence to support it:\r\n• a PT replied to my comment that I don't want to follow through with exercises that I don't have to, if I don't want to get better.\r\n[It's a fucking progressive disease without a cure. Thanks for shoveling the fault onto me.]\r\n• stretching is simple, easy, and very effective to HELP with reducing spasticity.\r\n• what else do I have to occupy my time? (what else that I want to do and can do)\r\n\r\nSo, what is what I want to do, need to do, or -- dare I say -- should do?	0	0
20	2022-02-23 15:47:26	trouble	I married him so I could avoid trouble. He kept me from trouble. Now I want trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nsometimes. somewhat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMostly, I want something.	0	0

I tried moving to the side but he still couldn't. Later another man said something like 'move woman, Jesus Crist...'\r\nThen I had to turn around, in the scooter, to get out the door behind me at the stop on Market.\r\n\r\nI hate being crippled.\r\nand crippling.\r\n\r\nWhile I was on the West side of MacAdam I again found myself thinking something along the lines of 'I don't belong here...anymore.'\r\nI don't fit in society. At least, not as I once did.\r\n\r\nI want to, and plan to, journal more, and write poetry...\r\nand\r\nand one day find something for myself.	0	0
22	2022-02-25 23:44:52	Happy Friday...still adapting	Yay: I made it through the week.\r\nOh, wow: I wear depends sometimes; I can't control all exiting parties...(1 or 2); I don't want to work on life, but I want to work?

23	2022-02-26 03:53:22	problems	I want to fiercely, ferociously, to do something. So badly that I don't like anything that's here, because I'm not there, yet...and never will be.\r\n\r\nOh, I'm clenching inside, wreathing and cramping to slip out of the prisons I find myself in now. I keep trying, and trying, and wanting and WANTING...but all for naught. It won't work. I hear others say what about ... or maybe I should try ... I might like ...\r\nBUT, if it's not the thing I want, forget about it. I want to leave. If I can't have what I want, I don't want anything here. I don't want to be difficult or obnoxious, but I don't want what I have.\r\nI feel I'd rather have more difficult things to deal with than to have what I have. At least in that situation I'll be able to feel I can be upset. At this time I *can* be upset and I *can* grieve, but I'm supposed to move past it. I'll move. Oh, I'll leave it with me as I leave others behind.\r\n\r\nI know I'm repeating but I'll say it again here.\r\nI didn't keep in contact with friends because I didn't feel good enough.\r\nI went to college to earn a BA or BS, not an MRS so I didn't invest in dating.\r\nI wasn't going to stay in one place so I didn't tie roots....anywhere or with anyone.\r\n\r\nÏ¨◊ ˆˇ >:º{\r\n\r\nI do feel...acceptable...or did. Now I'm just fluff. A floating diseased body without friends« yeah, I know. Monte and Hank. But at 85 and 87 I REALLY feel different. AND they drive. AND they've both had a career. And families. And I just feel like they have so much more than me.\r\nI have a peer to talk to (MS buddy), but she has kids and I still feel like I ran to outrun things and found myself alone and ƒ¨ç˚´∂ up and I know and I don't care if it's not my fault, it's still the truth. So, what now? What can I do? I'm broken and breaking and I want so much to have something.....and just having a supportive family and financial stability is not..........enough for me. I want connections. and I don't want to code. I think I'll write poetry and read tomorrow. Then there's the event on religion at night.\r\n\r\nOh, I want to date. I want to see what it's like to date someone. To get to know them. To have that excitement. To do it my way. To not do it the way that I think I /should/, but what I want.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do now that I want? Go to park ave cafe tomorrow and read. Write? Write at home. Walk to *$s...and back with a drink.\r\n\r\nGah, one more complaint. I think I 'like who I like', but that's another opportunity I shot as I only went for men who would use me...ƒ¨ç˚ me. Once and done. The one who wanted to continue I...didn't. ◊´˜ˇVENT◊´˜ˇ.close() \r\nI'd be more okay if I enjoyed and had fun with it, rather than using it as an example of at least...\r\n{spit}\r\n{ßπˆ†}\r\n\r\nDone with that. I was really enjoying some songs I was listening to, then it changed to a different genre, and now the player is closed. Ah, well.\r\n\r\nWeekend now so maybe things will get better. Even if I missed Shabbat services, and even if I AM going to the last Duties of the Heart meeting on Sunday, and even irrelevant of how long I'm at the disussion tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThings can get better. They can get better. They can get worse, but they can get better.\r\n\r\nGawd, it feels like life is just tolerating one thing after another. I'd like some enjoyment without the tension of discontent. Without the anxiety of when will the floor drop out. or when will contents move, next...\r\n\r\nI'll make tomorrow better.\r\n\r\nGood night\r\n\r\n\r\n	0	0

It's part of my reality. Things may change, but at this point it time, it's good.\r\n\r\nI'm getting stronger. \r\nBetter endurance. \r\nI have a training I /know/ is possible for me, in part because I've been doing similar things over the past few years: classes online. Plus, it's something I like doing, using skills I enjoy facilitating, and I'm learning and growing.\r\nOn top of that, it's something I want to do and it's a realistic and *growing* field!\r\nIt seems to good to be true because\r\n• I want to\r\n• I enjoy it\r\n• It's a sustainable activity\r\n• It's using skills I've developed over the years and even at UCB!\r\n• It feels like what I've done in my life has all more or less lead up to me doing this: training and becoming a research analyst.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nanother topic:\r\neven if I don't write music, I will write poetry and songs.\r\nI was going to today, but at this time I'm going to do something else I really want to do. First, Duo, but then what I really want to do is read C-:\r\n\r\n 	0	0

I responded 'no but thanks'. Honestly, I feel grateful to hear and see others thinking about other people around them.\r\n\r\nC:	0	0
32	2022-03-13 17:07:45.855964	push it, push it hold	I try to work on patience.\r\nI try to work on noticing the emotion before acting on it.\r\nI try to be patient and tolerant and I get tired of trying sometimes.\r\n\r\nJohn with his notion that 'Americans' find it difficult since they're so independent and self-driven and self-motivated and self-ish...\r\nIt hurts because that ideal of submission and obediance being hard for 'Americans' to understand feels like an inversion of the intolerance he may have felt for his beliefs. Like /I'm/ wrong for not being able to find solace in what he finds to be true.\r\n\r\nIt works for him, but not for me... and now I think of the crude comment about religion being like a penis...\r\nForget get that comment.\r\nI feel like I don't need to find truth in *your* beliefs to mean I accept it. \r\n\r\nHe's just so shy and seemingly timid (a lot of the time) that I don't think submission is needed. Go for obedience, but...grumble grumble do you need to *believe* in a higher power to do things? Yes? Okay, that's your thing. Don't make me feel bad for not believing, too. And don't try to convince me that my lack of belief is a perversion, or whatever negative adjective about the fact that you believe it.\r\n\r\nhrumph\r\n\r\nI'm going back to reading or coursework now. (or a little code investigation)\r\n\r\nbut first, we can't talk about it because it's like our two points of view, points of belief, can't exist simultaneously.\r\n\r\n***I put Americans in '' because you (John) say I make a point of pointing it out that you're talking about US, not all of North and or South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, I forgot until I submitted this post the first time and saw the title:\r\nI did a lot of upper body weights today, and increased to ten pounds for bicep curls. I know it wasn't the best form, but I did it, I did a lot, and then I went on an 8+ block walk.....and then frustration was much abated.\r\nReally the weights helped with that.	0	0

I got stressed about the driver's driving, and my vision shook.\r\n>fuck it< I don't want to go out to activities where someone (other than bus driver or (better yet) operator is moving the vehicle.\r\nThat said, I'll find that I'm content with activities in my area and NO cribbage at Elephant's, unless John drives there and home.\r\n\r\nAt this time, though, I'm home and I get to work on research analyst classwork. :)	0	0

The more I'd want to do the more I'd realize that there's less I can do. and the less I can do the more the nervous energy got stale and caustic and with that the more my mood would follow in becoming caustic and bitter and scathing.\r\n\r\nNow I'm ABLE to do more and I've found ways to do more and what I CAN do. and it's working, and helping.\r\n\r\nWow, I have so many thoughts that I want to write and I can't keep up. I stop typing for a moment, and I'm a full chapter ahead by the time I go to commence again with typing. I am now thinking about looking into speech to text for this journal.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'm going to submit this, then refresh to see the changes I added so that, hopefully, I can look up to the write at my text rather than down to the left.\r\n\r\nGood night. 	0	0

40	2022-03-15 22:39:09.568295	2022/02/02	 oo, today is 2.2.22\r\n\r\nnifty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, now, writing about what I want. I made it past my birthday/ weekend/ end of month 'ultimatum'. And I finished advanced MySQL administration. And I realize or am realizing how life 'really' is.\r\n\r\nI don't know that I want or need to get a job any more. Wow. That's a change. \r\n\r\nI was feeling earlier like I did a bunch of things; made a lot of choices in life because I thought that was the right thing for me to do, not necessarially the thing I wanted, and now I have a 'good' life, but not necessarily what I 'want', I also realize that a lot of what I 'don't want' is do to the fact that I have SPMS and maybe if I'd chosen differently I would be/feel differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, now what? Create the program I want with the knowlege I gained for programming and DB. Or, scrap that and just write. Or take classes\r\n\r\n• study German and history\r\n• study writing\r\n• write fiction\r\n• write non-fiction\r\n• autobiography\r\n    º nah\r\n• study random things that pique my interest\r\n• keep learning intro classes on edx.org\r\n    º mmmmm?\r\n• keep playing piano?\r\n    º learn more than the first line of River Flows In You?\r\n• interior design\r\n\r\nI think about moving, but I'll wait for this lease to be complete. Then, who knows where. I may have a better idea of what I'll be doing: there and in life.\r\n\r\nI plan to return to stretching daily, and try to include exercises, too. Not just over do it so I burn out like yesterday, though I did fall asleep more easily. :)\r\n\r\nNext question: how do I meet people. How do I stay connected? To whom do I want to connect?\r\nI know I have a short circuit to want to 'please', and find my connection by what I can do for you...\r\nI'll change that this year.\r\nI want to try to go about my day knowledge focused, and put sex in the back seat...or trunk. :)\r\nI will derive pleasure through knowledge, and grow and feed that knowledge.\r\nALSO, BIG I will look into what I can do non-physically.\r\nPlay to my strengths: perseverance, curiosity, dedication\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll join groups to speak in other languages\r\nor to discuss history\r\nor to discuss...	0	0
41	2022-03-15 22:39:57.249367	22.2.2 cont'd	For as much as I like novelty and changing things up, it seems that what I long for is consistency in activity. That makes sense in that what I am able to do is often changing due to job and MS symptoms. But, is that to say I want a job or to invest my time in one thing and build that ability, consistently. I think that now I should outline a 'plan' for  course of action and then follow that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?" (Avos 1:14). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was a quote I'd copied and I'm thinking of it now. I'm going to think more for what I want and less of what I think others want...or try to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will also try to think more of what I can do and >try< to think less about what is lost...and being lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe I could start 'what if'ing, but in a productive sense: what if 'X' was gone? What would I do?\r\n\r\nLIVING: where would I like to live.\r\n\r\n• café I can go to after the pandemic\r\n    º just read and enjoy the atmosphere\r\n• no balcony so it's more accessible to enjoy the living space to it's fullest\r\n• by transit\r\n• maybe by or easy access to a natural space: river, forest, mt...?\r\n• may be dt or outside of dt\r\n• space in time and electronically to write\r\n• internet\r\n\r\nI think listing things I can do in or by this place, during or after the pandemic will help/be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, I want to start living with curiousity, rather than a need to know. I want to be more open minded.	0	0
42	2022-03-15 22:44:35.509391	Stepping away from my db, for a moment [3.6.22]	 The problem with coding a journal while using it: It's not always available when you need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso, now, for the moment, I'm back here. Probably, if it's functional again, I'll copy and paste this into it later. maybe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor now, I'll see hoe long I can write here, before stopping and leaving...where I am seated. Funny thing is that I keep hearing the clip in the lyrics playing "...I don't want to sit still..."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, now, things I like, and then I can think on what or if there's something I can do.\r\n\r\n• reading\r\n• learning\r\n• being OUT of the house\r\n• productivity\r\n\r\nI was thinking earlier: I didn't want to get married before. >< and then I was ...shot myself in the foot.\r\nI would prefer isolation ALONE and doing things at home, MYSELF.\r\n\r\n• independence\r\n• planning\r\n• proofing\r\n• learning\r\n\r\nI think [feel] things would be better if I had a work from home job, in a studio, by myself, and interactions with others included food delivery, and café outings {if that's an option}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sounds great, still, so perhaps what I should do now is look for the remote job, and then separate...\r\n\r\n• writing\r\n• trying\r\n\r\nI want to leave the Melendy melancholy. ;-/\r\n\r\nI'll look at the proofreading site. And look at upwork again. And indeed some more. And linkedIn. And apply. This month.\r\n\r\nI was thinking before that I'd like to move somewhere else for that job...France?...Montreal?...but the MS trial is here.

47	2022-03-19 12:54:31.681049	no, you're not	When speaking with someone new Tuesday night, I was feeling down and I said,\r\n"I'm fucked up" "No, you're not"\r\n\r\nI indicated the rollator and thought about other physical limitations and more as I repeated,\r\n"I'm fucked up" "No, you're not."\r\n\r\nThis person didn't really even know me, but the answered assuredly, nope. It was as if in the same line as my statement. As though it was an easy and obvious truth.\r\n\r\nIt changed my viewpoint. Forget about other drugs to change my mind, just that statement, flowing along with my words, said with conviction, surprised me and shattered the false illusion I had of myself\r\n\r\nto some extent.\r\nSome great extent.\r\n\r\nMaybe the fact that he reminds me of a combination of friends/acquaintances from me past added to the result.	0	0

I don't want to follow 'morals' in terms of morally correct way of living. I don't like......I hate that some things are not okay to do, except for the people who think it's right for them and it's working for them. Is it not correct for me because that's what I think or because I don't want that.\r\n\r\nFrustration is boiling over.\r\n\r\nI hear someone talking about their values changing. What is justifiably changing values and what is a sign of finished trying.\r\n\r\nI heard one cannot pick and choose their values. I'm coming to find I disagree.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel like I'm in this marriage because I said I would SEVEN years ago...\r\n\r\n...and it provides for me\r\n\r\n...but I don't like him\r\n\r\n...but then sometimes\r\n\r\n...and there are the times when he...\r\n\r\n...but it's 50/50.

59	2022-03-26 13:15:42.168729	life & values	I'm not sure what I hold as a value vs what I just hold on to just because I do.\r\n\r\nAm I really egotistical or do I feel I 'should' hold myself apart, or that I need to. Or is that need for independence something else.\r\n\r\nIs standing apart from the crowd a positive or a negative?\r\nDo I want to snog someone else because of the thrill or because I just want to snog others?\r\n\r\n\r\nokay.  Start a lot of my speech to text with quote okay close quote ... so it goes.\r\n\r\n I was journaling by hand and keyboard and then realized my thoughts were moving faster than my hands were so I decided I should – could – use speech to text.  one day I'll figure out what punctuation I can use by speaking it, and what else need to either omit or go back and change later. For now, I'm going to enjoy just a block text, more or less. I'm thinking about life and my ambitions and what I want to do and what I should do and what I could do and what things look like now and probably how they look in the future. I think that it's great that there are some improvements, but I don't expect to have a cure or to have any of the issues I have resolved. At this time, I think that the best thing would be to find what I like to do that I can do at this time, and enjoy that. Rather than pushing the limits just to see whether or not I can actually make it there or keep trying because there is a *possibility*...\r\n I just want to live enjoying the definities? I don't know that that's a word but as of right now it is. I spent so long putting things off until things were better because eventually if I just do 'X' now then later I'll have time for the other things.  well I can tell you now, definitively, that's bullshit.\r\n  right now I'm thinking back to hang out with Britt on Thursday night and thinking about it one point when she said that we really had a good life. She could just imagine the person who was down to the hospital bed wishing that they could have a life like us. I see that, too. And yet, I still want more... And, therefore, I buried myself for wanting too much, or expecting more than the good things that I have oh, but I think it's possible.\r\n\r\n  Now the question I have is whether or not I stay with all the benefits that I have, push it away and go for my own something to be a detriment of me and my current connections, or just not act right now. I spent a lot of time not doing things so the idea of not moving forward with some action seems like I'm just doing what I've always been doing, but it's different this time. This time, I am working on a training program which will help me to get a job. maybe I'm still in the place where I'm thinking I should wait until I get a job oh, but I think that I'm also in a position that I can wait.\r\nI'm in a place that I enjoy being in with activities that I enjoy doing around places that I can go to and most of the things that are positive here are "can do it" things. I can walk to a cafe from my place and read and many other things...\r\n  and I do have a friend I can call up or text and arrange to meet and enjoy the evening with them and talk with them about silly things and serious things and good advice from not only a non-judgmental person, but also someone I call my friend.\r\n\r\n  I think at this time I'm going to just enjoy the things that I do enjoy doing (like go read right now) and then  decide what's next later. and this week I'll start week 4 for the grow with Google course I'm taking and I'll try one more week of enjoying things and just doing what I want.\r\n\r\n  playing the piano seems like an exciting thing and fulfilling thing that I would like to do, but at this time it's not what I want to do the idea of it is what I want, so it's not actually what I want. I'm more inclined to write at this time, Beyond journaling, but including journaling, ...\r\n\r\n at this time I'm happy that John and I went out to breakfast and then to the Apple Store and at no time during this outing was the pair of Depends I'm wearing necessary, but I felt more comfortable having it on and I'm glad to have gone out and enjoying the I'll be a chilly day. However I would much prefer to just go down to Starbucks and Reed and be able to be comfortable and not just pushing myself. True, today this morning was not just pushing myself, I did enjoy it, but I'd like to be able to do more that I enjoy not just as much doing things I enjoy that take a bit more courage? guts? Patients?   ??  I'm going to work on things this week which I find exciting and I enjoy them and it's not just thrilling because I'm breaking a rule or doing something that I shouldn't be doing.\r\n\r\n I'm going to go back through this writing to see if there are any obvious Miss spellings as in it's not even a word oh, such as I think I saw tubi somewhere in here and I know I did not say tubi.  anyways, I'm glad you're taking the time to write this and I look forward to whatever else I do today after this.\r\n\r\n one final comment I will attend to this post is that it's nice I found that I can make some editorial changes to this and then put the cursor back to the end and keep talking and have it still fill in.	0	0
63	2022-03-27 20:40:49.865388	all the positives sparkling around me	wow. Things are really going well now. I think this week I might try to find a way to make it so that I don't need to copy and paste from this box into the post content box, but maybe I won't...\r\n\r\n what I'm struck by his how well things are going and how well I recognize how well things are going. I live in a town that I am glad to be in [ walkability, public transit, friends, possibilities... ], I have grade health care thanks to the location and John's insurance, and I'm working towards a job working in data analysis. one. I'm fabulous at analyzing and over-analyzing things, too. I spent a year-and-a-half or more working on online trainings with edx oh, and now I'm working on a training with grow with Google through Coursera, and I have WorkSource and Vocational Rehabilitation with me to make this... Work!\r\nI'm almost afraid to acknowledge it at times but I enjoy spending time with bread so much that I sometimes wonder if it's going to go away... Whether or not it's another relationship or friendship that I'll lose. However, I won't. I really do have a life here. I really do have a life.\r\n\r\n and speaking of here, I'm going there: Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\r\n John and I will be flying there in a week and a half two weeks to spend about a week and a half there. I might work a little bit on Coursera work, but mostly we'll just be enjoying time off and seeing the back again, almost 7 years later. and, about 15 years later, I get to see Eira.   I haven't seen him since we graduated high school oh... And his name was Caitlin. I look forward to seeing him and seeing new places people and, yeah, I really look forward to speaking French when we go out.\r\n\r\n  this week I'm going to work on focusing on the positive things in my life, and really appreciating off the goods. This doesn't mean that I'll turn a blind eye to negative things, those will definitely still be there, but I'm going to try to feed more to the positive wolf. ;)\r\n\r\n  taking time with this dictation application that's really good to teach me it's abilities and Bill so the things that I need to keep in mind that it doesn't actually do, such as inserting the punctuation of a colon.\r\nI'd say this is sufficient for this evening.	0	0

Why do I feel such a strong need to prove myself? Why do I feel like age really makes a difference? Particularly, why does it make a difference if someone is younger than me? Why do I feel a need to set things as on or off, yes or no? Why do I always need to have something new to add to my CV of life? What could I do and be more content with life? Why do I want instability and uncertainty over safety and consistancy?\r\n\r\nThese are big questions I'll get around to exploring later.

71	2022-04-03 08:06:33.729476	ruins at the start	I feel like I ended up setting my self up from potential to failure. Spending years demeaning and devaluing myself and not taking the time to learn my interests and values, internally, I found solace in appeasing others, no matter what that meant for my self. Now what. Now I need to retrain thoughts that leap to self harm as an out for depression and meaninglessness.\r\nAnd I need to find what I like that is not also self ... reducing. And find a way to not always feel like I messed up and will now always be short of what I could be.\r\nThere is potential, but it's not an easy bright light to follow. It sometimes feels like at this time I need to just NOT do certain things.\r\nI'll make it...eventually.	1	2
72	2022-04-03 08:13:57.615363	delayed start	as though I had OCD and wouldn't start until my laces were tied just right, I spent a long time trying to 'fix' myself so that I could be my best self: perfect. But that's not a human expectation. or, not a humane expectation of a human.\r\n\r\nNow I'm lagging in life, or so it feels. I guess I need to just get up and be okay with not knowing all the answers or having everything just right, even not doing things perfectly for a person with SPMS. There are layers and levels to everything and I feel, or have felt, like doing the best I can do is doing it perfectly...or some ideal way.\r\n\r\nideally, I'm going to go eat breakfast now. well, not ideally, just saying I'm hungry so I want to go eat.	2	3

79	2022-04-13 11:03:07.131529	le meilleur matin	okay, this was the best morning ever!\r\n\r\n In the beginning, when I first woke up, I was very excited for starting my day. When I went back to lie on the bed things started to get worse in terms of my mood and thoughts. however, when I got up again and enjoy a warm shower and got cleaned up and dressed, things were better.\r\n\r\n John and I went to breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. I enjoyed a plate of fruit and toast.\r\n\r\n after breakfast I read for a while as John wrote on his computer. After I finished a section in the book, though, I was very tired and decided to return to the room.\r\n\r\n on my way back to the room, as I pass reception, I was asked how the taxi ride was and I responded that it went very well. I then asked about getting a ride on Saturday to Verdun. I was told to let them know about 10 or 15 minutes before I need to leave so they can call the taxi. I asked about how long it takes to travel to Verdun and I was told about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n as I was heading back to the room from the restaurant, before speaking with the person behind the front desk oh, I have been in a bit of a low mood no. However, after having an entire conversation in French without a problem Oh, I was quite elated!\r\n\r\n\r\n yes, the entire conversation I had with the man at the front desk was in French oh, and it went very smoothly!  At one point oh, maybe because I just wasn't stressing I was listening and hearing what was said but I found that I didn't need to translate word by word oh... I understood it!. Perhaps because I was so at ease listening it seemed like French was no problem for me and the person working there did not switch to English.  I feel incredible. :)\r\n\r\n last night, I have been thinking that perhaps today I should just speak so late in English to reduce stress and tension and belittling of myself for having some difficulty with understanding and remembering how to speak French, but it just came back to me. It's as though I just needed a little bit of less pressure on myself and that allowed things to work... I was going to say so much better, but simply, it allows things to work! :)\r\n\r\n this is a huge reassurance for me because I was thinking early this morning during my negative wallowing but maybe that possibility has, or that ability, has left me and whereas I could speak in French before, maybe now that is no longer an option. Maybe now other languages are in 10 operation. I realize now, that is not true. That makes me very happy!	5	5
82	2022-04-15 15:50:52.291394	life, mine, and opening view points	I have a lot on my mind. Mostly in English, some French, but mostly English.\r\n\r\nI don't want to stay married. Still. So that means I don't want to stay connected to John. Tough. Difficult, but true.\r\n\r\nI've tried for years. Sometimes more so than others, but I don't want to continue.\r\n\r\nYes it will be difficult, in some ways, but life is difficult.\r\n\r\nPotentially I've conflated John and MS. \r\n\r\nBut what does that mean: that I just stay and keep thinking of not staying?\r\n\r\nI have someone who loves me unconditionally, but do I want to be had by them, /still/?	4	3
83	2022-04-23 11:21:12.712021	what	I don't know where to place my energy. I want to expend it somehow, but, how will be useful?

I want to DO something, but what can I do?\r\nMaybe I could or should try the things I previously thought wouldn't be enough. Maybe now that's my limit of what I can do. \r\n• language\r\n• linguistics\r\n• other?\r\n• just enjoy and not need to look further.\r\n\r\nDo I swim and watch that ability leave...me.\r\n	2	3

I did more with postgres. Played around, and then with teaming up with John I now have a functional database through using postgres with vent on. At this point I can finally vent on for all of my madness spinning around which I point fingers at the virus for, but it doesn't change the fact that John has to do with it.\r\n\r\n one of these days I'll have the speech to text appear in the actual post context box, but for now I'm just going to smile.	5	5

I will finish this course, and I will learn R, but along the way I may be writing to Shannon... I do NOT want to be taking the time to visually set up a data viz, or anything for that matter. ><\r\n• My back (top right) is sore.\r\n• I look forward to having dinner with John and Dominic at Karam tonight.\r\n• I'm slightly inclined to say thanks and bow out of VR and just focus on my book and occasionally working on making VentOn into a fully fledged app...\r\n\r\n{breath}\r\n\r\nWhat now?\r\n\r\nThinking about VR, do I really want or *neeed* to get a job? no...and no...at this rate.\r\nWell, not tonight.\r\n\r\nJohn says that not all data analytics positions are like what Google is presenting, but........\r\nhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\r\n\r\n:| Okay, yes, a 3.\r\n\r\nWait, no, a 4 after thinking about what I have next.\r\nPlus, thinking about chatting with Mike: just look forward. Don't look to the past for answers.\r\n\r\nI will fondly look back at yesterday:\r\n- meeting up with Mike and chatting.\r\n- long -roll with John\r\n- Oishii Mika for dinner\r\n- other fun inside with John...\r\n\r\nOh, and fuck it: no more orgasming because that results in a sharp cramp. (intense momentary Charlie-horse)\r\nThe last three occasions: R calf; R insole which only resolved after massaging my foot; L hamstring. REALLLLLYY not an insentive. Plus the first two John was involved and it leaves me not wanting to be intimate. Maybe a little peeved at him by proxy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, time to get ready to go out for dinner. :)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of food: I had a delicious fig and artichoke heart pizza from Elephants with John today.

113	2022-06-10 21:34:07.740707	PM Complaints on Life	Yes, it's late.\r\nYes, I'm tired.\r\nYes, here come some of the same complaints, but if nothing else, I'll get the venting out here rather than as I lie on the bed trying to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nfirst, I do want to express my gratitude that I have a speech to text functionality in this application. I'm tired and I don't want to take the time to type this out.\r\n\r\n I realize that I can't say "new line" to return to the next line, or use quotes, but that's fine.\r\n\r\n I'm simmering on the fact that there are a lot of things that I can't do, and I want to just because... Because.\r\n\r\n  I want to have a job because that was always the end goal for me. without it, I keep feeling like I'm lacking, not there yet, or simply missing something. and there it is.   I don't like stopping because inside of me part of me feels that I forgot something and I'm missing something and going to make all the difference.\r\n\r\n  I would like:\r\n to continue with Duolingo; read; swim and other exercises at March Wellness; keep tinkering with coating\r\n\r\n in terms of reading--\r\n I'm going to finish the current nightwatch book that I'm reading, and then start on books in the bookshelf I have at home. maybe I really will preach a Swift version of this journal and make it into a program then I can open from my desktop. maybe I'll start making smaller programs just for fun. maybe I'll create a Mindless game talk you pie my time when I need a distraction. Maybe I'll keep Duolingo for that time, but if I'm really tired then maybe a Mindless game would be best.\r\n\r\n Many maybes in this post, but that represents the many possibilities, perhaps.\r\n\r\n back to complaining:\r\n I feel like there are many things which are expected or assumed, but maybe they don't actually even apply to me or exist for me except for what I put on myself.\r\n I do a lot. I know I do a lot. However, maybe it doesn't count because it's not the lot I want. Or, at least, it's not what I want to fill my time. Or, I don't count it is something to fill my time.\r\n\r\n I look forward to the next week because I think there will be a lot of good things and learning opportunities, and I thought of this before I was thinking that on Sunday I'll be speaking with Milt. THAT could be big! \r\n for the next week I will not be pushing myself to complete our programming lessons, or any data analytic lessons because I have decided I am not doing that oh, and that's okay. I will try, when things feel really difficult, to distract myself with Duolingo lessons. I will enjoy reading. I will enjoy March Wellness exercises. I will be kind to myself.\r\n\r\n I will try not to see things as All or Nothing, because they really aren't. All right as I please, and be pleased with anything I do right, and not feel like I am lacking from anything I don't. maybe I'll write gratitude and trees. Maybe I'll create a separate marker for entries which are from the Gratitude tab. maybe I'll go to Powell's and get a new book, though I'd prefer to read some of the books that I have currently and I have wanted to read, first.\r\n Maybe I won't think of my days and terms of accomplishments.\r\n Maybe\r\n\r\n Most of all I just want to enjoy my life.\r\n\r\n I think I'll see what I can do to live this next week for me.\r\n\r\n I could go to watch a Dragon Boat Race over the weekend, but I could equally just stay at home and relax and enjoying not needing to be somewhere.\r\n\r\n for now, I'm going to post this entry and then go to sleep, and sleep well.	3	4

115	2022-06-11 13:59:38.165178	drive without somewhere to go	I'm not sure what to do oh, and I want something to do.\r\n\r\n I know I don't have to do anything right now but I do feel like I need to separate stopping from giving up. at this point I'm feeling like I need to do something really big, not to show that I can, but because what I'm doing right now isn't working for me.\r\nGood news, I guess, besides the fact that this speech to text works oh, and the journal is functional, it said I don't want to get drunk reason to feel intoxicated buy the liquid I drink.\r\n\r\n I feel slightly ridiculous because I look in front of me and I see a bookshelf with many books to be read, and beside me is a phone with plenty of Duolingo lessons to do/ work through... But.\r\n\r\n maybe it's all those years of doing a dance with MS so that I could complete something else so that I could do something(work...have a job...) and now without a gold I'm kind of fizzling out of control. Slightly. Things are so good for me don't like it, at all.\r\n\r\n at this point I'm grumbling about who I'm with, because of all the things that I didn't allow myself to do before... But,... I think things are really good for me for the most part.\r\n I think at this point I'd like to practice taking a step back and allowing myself to feel negatively. There's no point in get at mad at myself for feeling upset. And yet I do.\r\n I think that I should drop cognition and motivation psych courses at Portland State because I'm still on a track of doing things to get from A to B. maybe at this point I should take my time to just read the books that I have go down to Powell's for another one, but leave school and class work out of my schedule.  potentially, having classes catch me the feeling, albeit positive, that I'm working towards something. I don't need to work towards something right now. I have worked, hard, and I am working through life.\r\n\r\n now that I have worked through some of those feelings of needing to do something or else give up on everything I think that I could enjoy a glass of wine and reading because I'm not doing that to escape something. I'm doing it to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n at this time, I'm going to go enjoy writing my own fiction.\r\n\r\nnow that I've written the title for this entry, I have some more comments. I realize, I keep trying to get in a car to go somewhere, metaphorically, but there's nowhere else I need to go. and, maybe, I also realize that I can't drive anymore once I'm in the car and that's discouraging. so, now, I'll try to look at things outside of the car.	2	4
116	2022-06-11 21:17:38.595534	Thoughts on the future	More maybes\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to just pause. Stop the job drive.  I feel so driven to get a job, but I don't know that I actually want one. it is definitely not worth it to drive or a job if I'm not going to stick with it or be able to manage it.   I am not continuing with programming. the exception would be if I want to add something to this journal:  I'd find out how to do it and make it happen, to the best of my abilities. but, I don't want to use Swift to make this application into a product to run on Apple, or my phone, or at least not yet. Either way, I'm going to take a step away right now to the point that I don't still have one foot in the pool. in fact, I might get on a plane and go somewhere inland... By that I mean, I don't want to leave a door open just in case I want to take a side trip to a former activity that I've done and left, try it again, and left again, and...\r\n I hate stopping things before they're done, or leaving things, or changing directions... As though I could keep doing everything that I start, as though I can just keep adding activities and not stop anything, but rather, complete EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\n I hate being sober functional, or feeling that I am. Today I was reminded of things that I was going to do once I 'fixed'  things.  Because I don't accept things, I-  or, because I keep having foolish lie optimistic thoughts, I keep convincing myself that one day things will get better, problems from Ms will be cured, and I'll be able to dance again. I do realize that that's a false belief, hope, premise...\r\n so what do I want to do?\r\n Like it ruffled when I try to think of that because I feel like I spent so much time telling myself but I just needed to do what I needed to do and then I could do what I wanted later after I completed what I needed to do now. well, I tried. Now I need to move on to whatever the next thing is without holding on to the praise strings from what I was working on before. the threats that aren't even attached to what I was working on before because I've trimmed and yet still think that it could be attached, despite the fact I know it's not.\r\n  In part, I don't want to try something new because I don't want to lose that too.\r\n  in part, I don't want to try something new because I just don't want to put the effort in. I put so much effort in...\r\n\r\n  at this point, I just want to limit things to that which I'm interested in oh, I want to do, I'm interested in. and yet, I feel like that's not enough. but what will be enough? Nothing, if I keep up what I'm going by now. and thus, I'm trying to recalibrate my programming to accept things as they are. to accept myself as I am. right now oh, right here, without any expectations of future changes.\r\n\r\n speaking of changes oh, I might move the start button to below this box so that I can have the box in the wider View, scroll to the base of it, and have the start button right there to click when I make manual modifications. Until another day.\r\n\r\nOne final thought: I may drop the psych courses I am registered for: Cognition and Motivation. Not yet, but it may be beneficial for me so that I don't feel overly pressured to do it for the reward of something at the end. Something beyond just the knowledge. And so as to reduce unnecessary stress.	4	4
117	2022-06-16 15:17:31.877154	The weight of fog	I'm not sure why but for some reason I think the confusion is actually trying to discern what this Oddity in my mind is:  potentially I'm just dealing with the weight of fog...\r\n\r\n can't seem to get myself to focus and when I do get closer it just seems like too much and I want to stop and go to something else.\r\n\r\n today I was considering going to Powell's and then I realized I don't actually want to get anything there. If I want a book I have some at home and I don't want to put the energy out to go and get a book on mathematics or psychology.\r\n I also both love getting in the pool and don't want to do it again.\r\n I also want to go and get a sampling of white wine and enjoy it with chips and spinach dip, but I don't think it would be good idea. For one thing, it might lead me to needing to get out of the pool to go use the restroom, again.  alternatively, it may lead me to knock it in the best night sleep and I think I should try to get as much sleep as I can tonight before going up to Sequim...\r\n\r\nI want to put Benton on to a w s, but more so I wanted to be there not to actually need to work to have it there. I also feel like I'd like to add another tab, that may be more for the sake of doing something and accomplishing something and realistically, I'm content with things as they are, especially because there's this speech-to-text functionality.\r\n\r\n I am happy that I have The Quirk of when I get really agitated and don't have anything I want to do but I want to be productive, I go do laundry.

There's a pretty good list. I'll go through it one by one and voice my thoughts. \r\n• data analytics. I think this both could and could not be a good idea. I don't know what company I'd be working for, but I don't know that the stress level that is present, or that I create, would be a good idea. This is predicting the future,  that it's also learning from past experiences. I'll put a ? by this option. \r\n• writing a novel. I enjoy being creative and imaginative and I think I could do this.

I think this is a good thing for me to be doing. I might need to limit the number of Aqua aerobics classes that I go to, such as only go to at most two per week oh, but this is possible. Plus, I leave with feeling of satisfaction, contentment, and endorphins. All good things. \r\n• receptionist. no. I think I have a positive and good personality for being a receptionist but, well, I don't know. Another ?. \r\n• working on admin? Not really? on one hand, I don't know how other administrative teams are, but I think it's a pretty sure bet that admin needs to be more on top of things and, well, administrative. I don't want to do that I don't want to add that stress to my life. it might be fine, but at this time I'm predicting that I don't want to. I'll leave it open though that's a possibility. \r\n• other. To be determined. I'm open to it. \r\n• Pick a class, PSU, Maybe. I'll put a?

I feel like my life just been doing activities in order to get somewhere and I am still not wherever there is an inch I'd like to enjoy living. This applies to take a class at PCC, as well. \r\n• travel. well, the fact that every time I say travel it is heard as trouble oh, maybe I should... Nevermind. I don't know where I want to travel. The other day I thought about asking just if she's like to travel together somewhere oh, but I don't know about that. Without said there's a lot I don't know about. Maybe I should just pick a place and go there. Assuming it's not too, too hot. I'll wait until the fall to pick a place and go. Someplace where I know that I'll be back in time for, oh darn.

Do I not want to go to work because I don't want to have that responsibility. Do I not want to work because I don't want the stress?

Therefore, I want to stop that progress before something else stops it.

Well, one of the lengths was me walking and using breast stoke to move forward. Actually, there were a few interesting lengths. One, I pulled water with my arms(~breast stroke) to assist with moving legs forward, then kicked (~breast stroke) and then used breast stroke arms to come up for air.\r\nAny way, I did it. I moved. I swam.\r\n\r\n	4	4

Good news?\r\n\r\nI regret too much. That was the theme of my thoughts tonight: regret.\r\n\r\nI don't connect things in life (people); out of sight out of...connection,\r\nMaybe MS is partly to blame, maybe it's just part of who I am...or what I am.\r\nah, the disconnect.\r\nmaybe I'll write a poem about the disconnect...at another time.\r\n\r\nfinal thoughts before returning to bed:\r\nI don't like the disconnect\r\nI don't like people\r\nI don't like not being able to connect (things or people)\r\n\r\nI want to hit things...or others...thank goodness for swimming...and weights, when I go for that. and resistance...etc\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'm going for data analytics because I want to or because I don't want to lose something else, or because I want something. Whatever. I'm continuing and I'll see what happens.\r\n\r\nbook...\r\nI'll write at my own pace. I won't badger myself to get 500 words per day if I'm doing other things, such as data analytics, I will continue, but...\r\nI'm on track. No need to fuss. I will write, but not pressure myself.

[what is within my ability, physically and financially.]\r\n4. wait to see what new, small things may come up.\r\n5. ?\r\n\r\n========================\r\nThoughts from this morning:\r\nI was thinking about an incident, as I sometimes do.\r\npoke and prod the memory to see what new incite I may gather from it.\r\none poke: 'did I go into the lair of a hungry tiger knowing what might happen? Because of what might happen? /Wanting/ what might happen?\r\nI came away from the sentiment of being furious at you for not doing something which you hadn't, with the feeling that that sentiment, that judgement is just me externalizing my shock in me wanting that, too. I /wanted/ you to do that. \r\nI want something new. Something exciting. Something that I wouldn't allow myself before...\r\n\r\n...yeah, okay, I finished the Data Analytics certificate. Something I thought, yesterday, that maybe I didn't want to finish it because that would prove I could. And that would go against my internal sense of not good enough. Incapable. Not going anywhere.\r\n\r\nBut, okay I'm glad I finished it. But I don't want to work in tech. not like that. I hurt and tense and stress and crack and cringe and swear and it's just hella uncomfortable. pressure. From myself. From trying to make it work with bad pathways in my system. ...scarred pathways.\r\n\r\nMy other thought this morning, following the...'desire':\r\nAnimal, then human\r\nI hear claims that humans are more evolved; read that we need to rise above that carnal...but we're animals first. We just happen to sometimes have other capabilities...sometimes.\r\nfuck morals and ethics and social traditions and customs and-><\r\n\r\nI don't know what of my society I want to emulate and what I want to acknowledge and then go my own way.\r\nMaybe I'll go for a small time something (job-wise). And 'unpaid work experience'.\r\n\r\nBut thoughts smaller than that endeavor, do I want to try to swim and workout as much? Do I want to just go to cafés and read and write? Do I want to get on a plane to somewhere just to go? Is it my walker that's holding me back? Should I reduce how much I try to go out and do, or just accept that it hurts to travel (walk) a lot and do it anyway?\r\n\r\nLast thing from today:\r\nLiving in the past <- I never stopped loving Janek, I just started hating myself, and I let that come between us, rather than leaning on him.\r\n\r\nWell, the Past is *past*. But how do I grow? I'm broken and braking, not growing. And I'm fucking tired of needing my activities to be amoung people 2-3X my age! I don't want to live amid that crowd until I get there, too. Gah, I want to live and I stopped myself for many reasons, many times. Now what?\r\nMaybe just writing and reading. Enjoy the reading and I can write...\r\n\r\nI'm done thinking. Off to bed.	3	4
129	2022-07-02 10:17:09.755185	outsider email	created: 2022-07-02 10:17:09.739654 -- I wrote this and send just now:\r\n\r\nGood morning, Rabbi Miller,\r\nI realize this may be a bit off, or fitting, for me to email you on Saturday to say my thoughts on Judaism.\r\nI've often felt like an outsider when it came to Judaism. Either because of the small Jewish community, or because my Mom and sister and I had to travel two towns away to get to the nearest conservative synagogue. (It's where my Mom's sister and her family went so we did, too. I never felt that connection that those who grew up in a big city or a big congregation might have had. I distinctly remember an awards assembly after school in middle school where there was a group of students waiting in the parking lot and one of my friends said, "I think we have the entire Jewish population here." There were maybe 8 of us waiting together before the event.  One person mentioned another person who wasn't there, but it was debated if they were actually Jewish. Either way, it was a small group of us and we didn't even belong to the same synagogue. Conservative and reform and, maybe, 'just Jewish', too.\r\nAny way, flash forward, at this time I think that religion is a man made concept. It has great potential, but it's not real, to me, in terms of what it means. Like a good story with morals. (but more powerful)\r\nWords and ideas can be very powerful.\r\nMy point in this is that I am not looking to disprove another's belief. My husband can have his own religion [he follows the Baha'ii faith] but I don't. I'm tired of feeling like I'm doing something wrong, which I have since being closer to a practicing Jew, to...not, to marrying outside of the religion. At this point, some people who are Jewish may have something to say about the fact that I don't want to have kids, irrelevant of my own health concerns.\r\nSuffice to say, though I may say more, I enjoy the comradery of meeting in KIT and seeing people who I have seen before, but I have different priorities and, perhaps, pillars in my life. Religion doesn't hold me up, it feels more often to pull me down.\r\nAt this time I'm trying to find what matters to me and what I want in life, and reading what someone wrote, and what another prominent person said about it, is not what I want to focus on.I mean, I am reading things that Marcus Auraleus wrote, but he wrote that humbly, not intending it for public consumption. I can read it and gain things to reflect on, but not ideals to strive toward which I will never be able to meet and just expect to accept that. That I am not as good as 'x' person...We all have our own talents and challenges. As things feel more and more difficult I don't want to perpetually remind myself on a daily basis how much better others are.For some, this act helps them in that it supports their drive to move forward. For myself, it helps to confirm I'm not good enough and will never amount to anything.It would be a daily habit of smudging dirt on myself to prove I will never be clean enough.\r\nIn short, I feel that religion isn't helpful to me or the betterment of me as a human being or a member of society.\r\nWith this said. I do find it to be a helpful source for me to practice patience and tolerance as I try to be accepting of my husband's religious practices, thoughts, and motivations.\r\nDo you have any recommendations for accepting the religious faith and commitment of a partner?The 28th of June was our 7 year anniversary, though we've been together for closer to over 10 years.I didn't know how connected he and his values were to religion until after we got married. I'm better at accepting it now, but any recommendations will be appreciated.\r\nI hope your shabbat is going well.Best,Hannah\r\n	4	4
130	2022-07-08 16:46:18.184872	ping-pong ride through hell	it is exhausting being on at ping pong right through hell.\r\n\r\n  I don't know what to do now, or next, or if I should even be thinking about next. Another person who I'm connected to in my life has had a big new step in their life and it just reminds me of how stagnant I am. I mean, I'm not ignoring the fact that I did just finish the grow with Google data analytics program I've been in, but I don't know what's next:  I don't know if I'm actually going to be able to get a job, hold a job, or participate in anything, at least something that's not virtual." at this point the cases of covid around where I live there are going up, and even if " it's just like getting a cold" or even if " it's nothing more than the flu"  I don't want it. I also don't want to put my life on hold it any longer.  but that's just kind of my way of life now, isn't it? I live my life frustrated with the unfairness of health challenges, and at the same time feeling that I can't be unhappy because of all the good things that I have. but that just kind of makes me feel like I want to get rid of the good things so that when I complain about the bad things, it really is all bad... Or at least there's more bad than good. and any good that there is is of my own doing, or luck. I feel like I want to go somewhere new start something new try something new, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm equipped with the ability to do...new... Or simply do. sometimes my life feels like it's just a series of " just need to get past"..." just one more thing"... and I'm tired of it. time to be wonderfulness that is my life I feel like I can not only feel old but see old when I look in the mirror.\r\n I feel like I'd really like to have just one day outside of this reality where I can experiment with other experiences... And then come back to reality oh, if I so choose post office however, in this alternate reality, there's also not a pandemic, or covid-19 to deal with.\r\n I'd like to be able to go to Suki's or 21st Bar & Kitchen to sing karaoke. I want to go on a date with someone new. I want to drink with friends until I'm tipsy. or more. Maybe do some stupid things, but no stress. No perfectionism.\r\n\r\nFuck perfectionism.\r\n\r\n sometimes I like writing the story that I'm writing, but other times not so much.\r\n\r\n and now I'm realizing but the start button under the text box doesn't actually work.\r\nI'll remove it after posting, later.\r\n\r\n back to the frustration: I want to scream, I want to punch a wall, I want to...hurt...something.  I want to go on a trip to a place where I don't need to worry about what others think or what I do or what I think.\r\n\r\n biggest thing is probably that I want to be happy where I am and not constantly feeling like I need to run away.\r\nAlong with that, I want to be content as I am and not constantly feeling like I need to do more, do something else, be more.\r\n\r\nI have been told I am enough, but I sometimes wonder what makes that true, because if it's my sticktoitness then I can't stop doing, and if it's my level of activity then I can't do less, and if it's just in being myself...what needs to remain for the statement to stay true?	1	3

Rather, I feel like I'm floundering as I wait for something to manifest.\r\nIf I'm working toward work, I want to have an end in mind.Else, I need goals or rings to put my hands on, and hold on.\r\nI wrote to DPI and voc rehab about next steps, after talking with Brian, and he recommended to also talk to you about goal setting.\r\nI've been spending a lot of this year split: one foot in the out of work zone, and one foot in the still trying zone. Leaving feels like giving up when it comes to the work field. But I also feel like I'm doing something wrong if I'm not trying for it.\r\nThat said, though, I want to say no to publishing the capstone. It's too late. I'm past it. It's a field where I get myself through it by hating myself, and/or trying to prove myself wrong as I say how horrible I am and how I couldn't do it anyway.On one hand I think that maybe if I take the full week it suggests for the capstone, maybe I can complete it (a different one) with a sense of curiosity. On the other hand, I still feel the stress of all of the tech I've done just to find it doesn't work for me or doesn't go anywhere.\r\nOne other thing on the capstone, I found it ironic that after telling you I did so much with the interests of others' in mind, you tell me you think I should finish it and I just jump in with, "ok!". It's not as simple as I thought it would be. There are more steps that I didn't do and don't want to. And maybe I just shouldn't aspire to work.\r\nBrief recap:• goal setting• somethings to look forward to• can I have your 'okay' to leave the capstone behind me and give up on that?\r\nUnrelated: I forgot to tell you that I bought a book entitled, "The CBT Workbook for Perfectionism." I've only just at chapter 3: 'Discovering the roots of your perfectionism'. I don't know how helpful it will be other than something to do. It has only covered things I already know to be true about myself.\r\nI know I can't 'go back' and redo what I've done...or in my case what I didn't do, but I don't know that I have much to look forward to. Do I fill it with a job, or give up and not try for that, any longer? Just read to learn and forget about ambition? Or try....\r\nIf I'm going to be unhappy no matter what, why stay in this unhappiness? Why not leave the marriage? Why not apply for a fulltime job that will drain me mad until I'm let go or forced to resign?\r\nI'll make no major decisions at this time...as always. My life is about waiting for a better time/weather/chance and not acting. And banging my head against a wall waiting for it to move.\r\nI feel like things won't change unless I do something, but I don't know what that something is, nor what's safe to try.Best,Hannah	3	3

So, I'll list my wants and assess them to find out what I really want and decide if and how I'll get it.\r\n\r\n1) move to Berkeley\r\n2) Travel\r\n3) not see parents in person\r\n4) job in DSP or DRC\r\n5) Leave John\r\n6) swim\r\n7) leave the apartment in the morning\r\n8) see friends\r\n9) do something new\r\n\r\n1-- Good things happened in Berkeley.

Even if I go back, I won't get back to how I was physically.\r\nAlthough\r\nIt is cooler there/ doesn't get as hot in the summer.\r\nBUT\r\nI might still be unlikely to get a job.\r\nI won't have Providence St. Vincent's [Dr. Cohan]\r\nI won't get around like I can in Portland, probably.\r\nBut that's a probably, but DEFINITELY not how I could when I lived there 11.5 years ago.\r\nMORE EXPENSIVE\r\nthough, SSDI would probably go up...\r\nBUT\r\nNot as accessible. Not having AC as easily? Or more costly, at least.\r\nSTILL grumpy [I'll get to my predicament later.\r\nI would be near UCSF, but unlikely as personable as St. Vincent's? maybe not?\r\n\r\n2-- I want to travel freely without needing to think of so many health and accessibility factors. I could prep a ready-go bag, but I'll still need it. Maybe just keeping a list of necessary things. Take that const to all plans and it will be easier.\r\n\r\n3-- I'm exhausted and I haven't shown or told them all that I deal with, which is exhausting, and I don't want to bring them down. Maybe I'll just proceed as though I have and tell them my needs as they become...needed.\r\nBUT\r\nTics and habits?! Distance is better for now. I can't just get up and move away as easily now.\r\n\r\n4-- Why? It's what I always said I didn't want\r\nBUT maybe I've changed\r\nno, DEFINITELY I and my cercumstances have changed.\r\nMaybe joining that field will be a form of adapting?\r\nBUT\r\nI'm not working.\r\nMaybe volunteering?\r\nBUT\r\nNot moving to Berkeley...?\r\nMaybe it'd be important to not accessibility if needed at DRC.\r\nMaybe I want to move. New?\r\nBut NO. What I want to leave will come with me [MS]\r\n\r\n5-- I feel trapped, but it's MS more than him. He actually takes over / fills in for where I'm lacking now.\r\nBUT\r\nI berate myself for getting so sensitive about his habits and allergies.\r\nBUT\r\nThat's more a me not him thing.\r\nDo I want to leave?\r\nThat sounds exhausting. I'll travel first.\r\n\r\n6-- I feel like it's fun to be more functional, but I'm not. Not really. It's exhausting and I'd rather find solace without pushing myself to my limits.\r\n\r\n7-- Again, I'm going to try to not push myself too much. I can go out\r\nBUT\r\nnot in hot whether and not over exerting myself. Not just pushing to get it all out.\r\n\r\n8-- I will\r\nBUT\r\nnot at the expense of my health. It's not worth it to me to have one really good thing and then need to recuperate and recover for days.\r\nLittle bits or cooler weather is better.\r\n\r\n9-- How about relax!? Read...take it easy...less stress...?\r\n\r\n10-- If I keep looking, I'll likely just be discouraged. I can read up on latest research\r\nBUT\r\nThere is currently no cure and no way to fix the damage I've incurred. It's tough, but it's the truth...for now. At this time it may be better to just focus on things that make me happy, or I might enjoy, or just be glad for having 'x' and not 'z'.......and, yeah, okay, VentOn!!!\r\n	3	4
